Jordan and Jennie have both been working on the backend. 
For milestone 1, they have designed the general architecture for the backend. Jordan has been working on updating the parser and he has been thinking about the SQL code generation. Jennie has been looking into getting a basic REST API up and running.
For milestone 2, Jordan completed most of the parsing/SQL code generation and is able to run queries from homework #1 on this new RA. He is working on better error messages and deployment of the server. Jennie has set up the Spark REST API so that queries can be sent from the frontend interface to the backend RA parser, with JSON objects passed back to the user. She is working on setting up more endpoints for querying schema structure.
For the final submission, Jordan and Jennie built an endpoint that exposes the abstract syntax tree for the query, tested the existing endpoints, and fixed bugs.

For milestone 1, Michael and Kevin have both been working on the frontend. Michael implemented autocorrect and text coloring. For milestone 2, Michael implemented scrolling access to previous commands, help commands, subquery handling, and multiline queries for the terminal. 
Kevin has been working on the right pane, using D3.js to implement the tree generation code. For milestone 2, Kevin completed a functional prototype of the drag and drop AST generation GUI.
For the final submission, Michael added more features to the terminal emulator, and completed the connection to the backend. Kevin completed two-way communication between the left and right panes.
